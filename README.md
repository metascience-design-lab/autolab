Scripts for automation.

## scheduler.gs

Takes a list of people from the spreadsheet, finds the ones that are not eligible and cancels all appointments with them.  To use, change the variables `sheetId`, `calendarId` and `eligibilityColumn` with the correct fields.

## highlighter

Highlights the row based on whether it is 'Accept', 'Reject' or 'Maybe'.
